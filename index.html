        <p>I am a Computer Science major who spends their free time reading and playing tennis. 
            I love learning all that is to know about web development and data analysis.
            I love web development because I enjoy seeing how information can be shared across a wider
            variety of people unlike when using physical media. Being able to create websites is interesting
            as it allows me to be a vital part of that important communication process.
